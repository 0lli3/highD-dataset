## highD Tools
This repository contains a collection of functions to handle highD data files implemented in Matlab and Python.
The functionality ranges from data handling to visualizing the data.

We extend the MATLAB functions to extract lane changes from the highD data.
We prepare these data to be used in a machine learning context to learn lane changes from the highD data.
